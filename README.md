# SoundGUI
simple audio .wav player


This is intended to be a simple expandable audio player written with python

Theoretically this could be used for all sorts of purposes:
 - testing audio filters and effects 
 - measuring loudness and distortion levels

The current limitations are -- 
 1. only accepts 8,16,or 32 bit .wav files currently
 2. the list of tracks clears itself with you add a new row
 4. There are still print statements in the code because it is still in testing 


In order to use GUI, simply run soundgui.py
