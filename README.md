# SoundGUI
::simple audio .wav player::


This is intended to be a simple expandable audio player written with python

Theoretically this could be used for all sorts of purposes:
 :: testing audio filters and effects 
 :: measuring loudness and distortion levels

The current limitations are:
 :: only accepts 8,16,or 32 bit .wav files currently
 :: the list of tracks clears itself with you add a new row
 :: There are still print statements in the code because it is still in testing 


In order to use GUI, simply run soundgui.py
